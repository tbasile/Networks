This directory contains the data used in the paper. Folders correspond to the six sports studied. The sport's name and initials of the corresponding association give each folder its name. 

Each folder contains a file called "time_list" including the dates considered for the data analysis. Moreover, they include a directory called "data" containing files named after each date in the corresponding "time_list" file. 

Each of these files has a double-column format. The first column contains a unique ID of the player or team. This can be a number given by the association (for chess), the name of a person (for golf, poker and tennis), a club (for FCWR) or a country (for FIFA). The second column contains its score at the corresponding date.
